Pre-render based on Sitemap as an API.

Sitemap will need to include all URLs for news etc.

Pre-render to be enhanced with absolute URL's from .env vars.

Callback from saving entry to run **npm run static**.

Should probably clear all, just in case of related content.

Since there will be no PHP, should be secure & quick.

CMS on subdomain.

Assets on subdomain.

Don't expose command to web-hook unless authenticated.

`<head>` data will need to be set for each page.

Ideally, will build to a app/static-{timestamp} or app/static-{semver}.

Will then switch.
